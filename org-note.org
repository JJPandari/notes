My favorite scenes are (in this order)
1. The attack of the Rohirrim
2) Eowyn's fight with the witch king
   + this was already my favorite scene in the book
   + I really like Miranda Otto.
Important actors in this film are:
- Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
- Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.
